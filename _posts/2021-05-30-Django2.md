Python3 is located in /usr/bin/python3, which is a system preference. You can install additional packages such as TensorFlow using this Python, but if you need to operate and manage a variety of development environments, it can be somewhat dangerous to touch Python in this system.


## 2. Install homebrew   

Open Mac's terminal app which you can find via spotlight like below:

Enter following command:   
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

On the way, password is required. Enter your Mac's login password.   


## 3. Install python or anaconda   

[파이썬 설치 링크](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)   
[아나콘다 설치 링크](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)   

(If you install any of the most recent versions, programs may not run properly.)   

You may enter the following command on the terminal app to check the version of python and to check if the installation has completed properly.
```
python3 - V
```
