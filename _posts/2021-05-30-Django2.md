## 1. Install Xcode

Python3 is located in /usr/bin/python3, which is a system preference. You can install additional packages such as TensorFlow using this Python, but if you need to operate and manage a variety of development environments, it can be somewhat dangerous to touch Python in this system.


## 2. Install homebrew   

Open Mac's terminal app which you can find via spotlight like below:

Enter following command:   
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

On the way, password is required. Enter your Mac's login password.   


## 3. Install python or anaconda   

[Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)   
[Anaconda Installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)   

(If you install any of the most recent versions, programs may not run properly.)   

You may enter the following command on the terminal app to check the version of python and to check if the installation has completed properly.
```
python3 - V
```

## 4. Download and install IDE (or Editor) that supports Python   

[Pycharm Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)   
Go to the link above and install Pycharm Community Version for free. Other editors that support Python programming include Atom, Sublime text 3, Visual studio code. 


## 5. Install Django   

1) Open terminal app and set up virtual environment.   
Before installing Python-based frameworks, libraries, and tools, development environments need to be separated from other python-based development environments to prevent versions of programs from being twisted.   

2) Install virtualenv   
```
> pip install virtualenv
```
Pip is a program that helps you install Python's programs with simple commands.   

3) Now create a folder to launch your first django project.   
```
> mkdir first-django 

You can think of a web service as corresponding to a single project folder. Here, I will create a folder named <first-django>.
