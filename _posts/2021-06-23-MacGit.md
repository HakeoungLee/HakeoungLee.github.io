# 1. Git Installation   
Git is a type of Version Control System (VCS).  Version Control is the management of a batch of files in a project unit as a single version when programming. For example, a single file can be updated and managed by creating versions of a task as 'demo.py', 'demo_2.py', and 'demo_3.py'. If version management is done at each additional section, the project can be safely moved to the desired version at any time.   

First of all, if you don't have GitHub account, sign up here: https://github.com   

Then, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads to install Git for MAC.   
If you have the XCode app on your mac, try typing the git command in the terminal because git might be already installed. If you see any explanation related to git, you can assume the installation is complete.    

# 2. Initial User Settings
Open the terminal app and enter the folder you want to manage with git. For example, the commands for creating and entering into the test folder under the Documents folder are shown below.   
```
cd Documents // Enter <Documents> Folder   
mkdir test // Create <test> Folder   
cd test // Enter <test> Folder
```

Type the command below. (Write your GitHub nickname or ID to express yourself on the "Your Name Here" place.)   
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
```

Now put your own email to the "your_email@youremail.com" part. The purpose of this command is to leave a message about who made the modification when creating Log.
```
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

# 3. Creating Git Repository
Now create a repository on github. Think of it as creating a folder on the server to manage its version.

# 4. Uploading Files
Come back to the terminal app and in the test folder we created, enter below command:
```
git init
``` 
This command initializes git in the folder. In short, it declares that it will now manage the folder with git.
