It provides an enjoyable environment with the various functions below:   
- Video chat (You can automatically connect to other users and have video or voice conversations. Like other collaboration tools, it is possible to change the current status or turn on/off the microphone/camera. In most cases, meetings are held in separate room spaces because other avatars passing by can be connected.)
- Share board and documents
- Find a user's location (following the avatar)
- Send a note
- Link External
- Games (Tetris, Dice, etc.)
- Decorate space (Mapmaker)   

Up to 25 people can use Gather.town for free. If you have more than 25 people, you can choose from three plans that offer different costs and capabilities.   

You can decorate your space and make your own avatar in Gather.town.
